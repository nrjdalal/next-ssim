          ‘Business Education is about capability, not the knowledge of facts.’
          As an educational institute, we aim to connect talent with
          opportunity. Talent resides in a student who can aspire to pursue
          management education along with opportunities in life and career
          beyond. The Institute prepares students to face challenges and exploit
          opportunities in globalised economy that is marked by volatility,
          uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity.

        <p>
          At SSIM we understand that placement activity is of critical
          importance that will require working closely with students for
          competency mapping, career counseling and finding suitable placements
          for them. With the structural changes in the economy and new
          technology being adopted by industry, reskilling and upgrading would
          ensure the smooth functioning of industry, with increased
          productivity. We also emphasize on talent adaptability score as an
          indicator of the ability to respond to future shifts in demand for
          placement. Our approach for the emerging world needed integration of
          required skills and managerial education with the main fundamentals of
          academics so that the student is geared and motivated to meet the
          challenges of current times.
